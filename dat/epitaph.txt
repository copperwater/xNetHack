Home Sweet Hell
Humpty Dumpty, a Bad Egg.  He was pushed off the wall.
I KNEW this would happen if I lived long enough.
I TOLD you I was sick!
I ain't broke but I am badly bent.
I ain't even mad.
I ain't old.  I'm chronologically advantaged.
I am NOT a vampire.  I just like to bite... nibble, really!

I am never eating cursed fortune cookies again.
I am not dead yet, but watch for further reports.
I believe them bones are me.

I don't need to unencumber myself, they're only soldiers, I've been killing soldiers, I'll be fine.
I don't wanna go!
I don't want a big chunk of rock put by my grave.
I hacked myself to death
I have all the time in the world
I knew I'd find a use for this gravestone!
I know my mind.  And it's around here someplace.
I like it better in the dark.

I'll just hit this thing one more time, it'll die.
I'm doing this only for tax purposes.
I'm gonna make it!
I'm not afraid of Death!  What's he gonna do? Kill me?

I'm not saying anything.
If a man's deeds do not outlive him, of what value is a mark in stone?
If you thought you had problems...
Ignorance kills daily.
Ignore me... I'm just here for my looks!
Is that all?
Is there life before Death?
Is this a joke, or a grave matter?
It happens sometimes.  People just explode.
It must be Thursday.  I never could get the hang of Thursdays.
