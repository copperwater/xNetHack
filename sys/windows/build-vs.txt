Building NetHack using the Visual Studio IDE

Prerequisite Requirements:

  o Visual Studio Community
        A copy of a version of Microsoft Visual Studio Community needs to
        be installed on your machine. Visual Studio Community can be either
        the version for Windows 11 x64 for use on machines with
        Intel/AMD64 processors, or the version for Windows 11 ARM64 for
        use on machines with ARM64 processors (Snapdragon).

        You can opt to build for a target x64, or for a target ARM64
        on either the x64 version of Visual Studio, or on the ARM64
        version. Versions of Visual Studio, since Visual Studio 26,
        are able to compile for the native host platform and
        cross-compile to the other target platform.

        If you want to selectively cross-compile for both x64 and ARM64
        target types, ensure that the necessary Individual Components for
        both types of target builds are selected (checked-off) in the
        Visual Studio Installer Individual Components dialog:

        Under Compilers, build tools, and runtimes:
            o MSVC Build Tools for ARM64/ARM64ED (Latest)
            o MSVC Build Tools for x64/x86 (Latest)

        You can use the Visual Studio Installer "Modify" button
        to add missing Individual Components after installation,
        if needed.

        See:
        https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
  o Lua
        NetHack 3.7 for Windows requires 3rd party Lua source that is not part
        of the NetHack distribution or repository.

        A windows cmd command procedure for fetching prerequisite sources
        is available, and can be run as follows from the top of the
        NetHack source tree to obtain lua:
            sys\windows\fetch.cmd lua
  o pdcursesmod (Only required if curses interface support is desired)
        If you want to include curses interface support in NetHack 3.7 for
        3rd part pdcursesmod source code is required and is not part of the
        NetHack distribution or repository.

        A windows cmd command procedure for fetching prerequisite
        sources is available, and can be run as follows from the top of
        the NetHack source tree to obtain pdcursesmod:
            sys\windows\fetch.cmd pdcursesmod

This processes produces a zip file containing two executable
versions:

    a. A TTY and curses version of NetHack in nethack.exe
    b. A Windows and curses graphical version in nethackw.exe.
