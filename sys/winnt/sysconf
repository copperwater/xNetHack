# *** LOCATIONS ***
# IMPORTANT: If you change any of these locations, the directories they
# point at must exist.  NetHack will not create them for you.
#
# HACKDIR is the default location for everything.
# Note: On Windows HACKDIR defaults to the location
#       of the NetHack.exe or NetHackw.exe file so
#       setting HACKDIR below to override that is
#       not usually necessary or recommended.
#HACKDIR=c:\games\nethack
#
# The location that users can adjust their config file startup options
#CONFIGDIR=c:\games\nethack
#
# The location that level files in progress are stored (default=HACKDIR, writeable)
#LEVELDIR=c:\nethack\levels
#
# The location where saved games are kept (default=HACKDIR, writeable)
#SAVEDIR=c:\nethack\save
