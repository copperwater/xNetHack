DLB(6)                           Games Manual                           DLB(6)



NAME
       dlb - NetHack data librarian

SYNOPSIS
       dlb {c|t|x}[v][C directory] [file] ...

       dlb {c|t|x}[v]I list-file

       dlb {c|t|x}[v][f archive-file-name] [file] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Dlb  is  a  file archiving tool in the spirit (and tradition) of tar(1)
       for nethack(6) version 3.1 and higher.  It  is  used  to  maintain  the
       archive  files  from which the game reads special level files and other
       read-only information.  Note that like tar, the letters specifying  the
       operation  and  options  are  expressed as a continuous string.  Unlike
       tar, dlb is configured with a default set of file names to process.

   Operations
       c causes dlb to create a new archive from files in the  current  direc-
       tory.

       t lists the files in the archive.

       x  causes  dlb  to extract the contents of the archive into the current
       directory.

OPTIONS
       C dir        Change directory to dir before trying to read any files.

       f archive    Read from or write to archive instead of LIBFILE  (usually
                    the nhdat file in the playground).

       I list-file  Read  from  list-file the names of files to emplace within
                    or extract from the archive.  The default for archive cre-
                    ation is LIBLISTFILE.

       v            Operate verbosely.

EXAMPLES
       Create the default archive from the default file list:
              dlb c

       List the contents of the archive foo:
              dlb tf foo

BUGS
       o Not a good tar emulation; - does not mean stdin or stdout.

       o Should include an optional compression facility.

       o Not  all  read-only  files for NetHack can be read out of an archive;
         examining the source is the only way to know which files can be.
