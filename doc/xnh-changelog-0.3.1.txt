xNetHack 0.3.1 Changelog

This is a minor update version of xNetHack. It is a fork off of
the vanilla NetHack 3.6.1 release, and is also based directly on
xNetHack 0.3.0. It will continue to contain all of the latest commits
pushed by the vanilla devteam; see doc/fixes36.1 for these changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, it might be out of date; in case of conflicting
information, this changelog and others in this folder are more up-to-date than
the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.6.1, and any changes
made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 0.3.1 contains the following
gameplay changes:

Remove the scroll of amnesia. In its place, create the scroll of water, which
  behaves mostly like UnNetHack's scroll of flood, except it will never create
  a pool underneath the player. It costs 200 and takes 4-7 ink to write. It is
  unblankable except by acid.
Also from UnNetHack, random graves may have a scroll of water placed on them,
  and the epitaph is then "Apres moi, le deluge."
Remove mind flayers' amnesia. They still drain Int.
